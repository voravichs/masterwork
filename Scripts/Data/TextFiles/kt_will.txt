LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

I, Kaito Tachibana, being of sound mind, do hereby declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, 
hereby revoking any and all wills and codicils previously made by me.

I declare any person who accesses this text file to be the executors of my will. I leave no material possessions or great fortune to my estate. I have naught buy my final creation, that I poured my soul into, to leave the world: what I would like to call "Tachibana's Masterwork."

Tachibana's Masterwork is a program hiding within this custom operating system of my own creation. Those closest to me know my love for puzzles. Thus, I have left my creation behind lock and key, buried deep in the file system of this OS. I do this so that I can entrust Tachibana's Masterwork to those are worthy and capable of understanding it. I trust that you, as the executor of my will, shall carry forth my legacy.

Seek the executable named "tachibana_masterwork.exe" within this file system. 

I shall be eagerly watching your progress.

-Kaito Tachibana
